My journey into front-end development began at a hackathon organized by [axmit](https://axmit.com). I participated in it together with a team of other guys. We were in the top three finalists and were invited to work.

At axmit I worked on many outsourced projects such as Zelos (https://getzelos.com) and Activatica (https://activatica.org).

After that, I got a job at [inter://so](https://interso.ru/) as the main front-end developer in their startup project.
