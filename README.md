Hello everyone!

My name is Rakhman Abdurakhmanov and I'm an experienced front-end developer with over two years of experience, specialising in React and TypeScript. I am passionate about creating efficient and user-friendly interfaces. My background in mathematics gives me a strong analytical foundation, which comes in handy on front-end projects.

I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can use my creativity and technical skills to achieve impactful results. I'm constantly learning and keeping up with the latest trends in front-end technologies. This allows me to quickly adapt to new   frameworks and create innovative solutions that drive business growth.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new programming approaches through personal projects and contributing to open source communities.

You can contact me via [email](<mailto:madliani@hotmail.com>).
