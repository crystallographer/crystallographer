I am a frontend developer whose path to programming began with a language much more complex than JavaScript. It was C++. Then there was a much simpler language, Python. But that was all for myself or for studying. Then I started to learn languages in order to get a job. It was PHP, Java, C#/ASP.NET. And finally JavaScript with React. That's where I settled on.

Somehow the company I wanted to get into organized a hackathon. I was there with a team of other guys. We were in the top three finalists and were invited to work there. However, the development language was not JavaScript, but TypeScript. But the experience in C# and Java made it easy to learn.
