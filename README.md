My journey into frontend development began at a hackathon organized by axmit. I participated in it together with a team of other guys. We were in the top three finalists and were invited to work.

At axmit I worked on many outsourced projects such as Zelos (https://getzelos.com) and Activatica (https://activatica.org). But I worked there until I was drafted into the Russian army. That was before Ukraine.

After that I got a job at inter://so as the main frontend developer in their startup project. But because of the events in Ukraine I had to leave there and go to Georgia.
